<p class="one">Hi everybody!

 I'm Sai Priyanka Haridasu, CS grad student from University of South Alabama where I finished my first semester (with a 4.0/4.0 GPA).
 I am very excited to be here ( at River University) with you all and 
 I really love this campus and Boston overall. I feel we have better course work compared to my previous university and few other universities, 
 which I was considering, and this is the primary reason why I transferred over. </p>

<p class="two">Coming to my past, I am from Southern part of India from  a place called Guntur  close to Hyderabad.
 I did all my education, right from kinder-garden to my under-graduation, in my home town. 
 I love playing chess, listening to music and solving puzzles. 
 I love to constantly challenge myself with new and difficult problems both in personal life and in career. 
 I regularly watch Ted Shows to motivate myself to learn new technologies and I am a big fan of Elon Musk.</p>

<p class="three">Few years down the line I like to see myself running my own software development firm at my home town and
 I like to start my career as a C# developer, which I think is a perfect launching pad for my career. </p>

<p class="four">Coming to my family they are the dearest friends and very loving guardians.
 My father is a business man and mother is a home maker and my sister is perusing her undergrad in CS.
 Because of all the love they showered upon me, I cannot even imagine a life without them and even if I had such a nightmare that would be my biggest nightmare.
 So with my families support I like to start an orphanage in Guntur.</p>

<p class="five">Hope I can raise good funds from all of you ........................... :)</p>
